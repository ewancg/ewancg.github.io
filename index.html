                I'm a software developer born & based in the Denver metropolitan
                area, mainly concerned with systems languages, native software,
                and open source. When coding for myself, I enjoy writing code in
                functional and declarative programming paradigms using languages
                like C++ and Rust for specialized tasks, using various shell
                scripts and Nix for infrastructure related tasks.

                <mark>I am currently looking for work.</mark>
                I have proven, hands-on experience developing desktop
                applications (as a hobbyist) and web backends for
                internal/employee-facing use (as a contractor). Because I am a
                developer who originally taught themselves out of pure interest,
                this does not scratch the surface of fields I'm familiar (and
                open to working) with. I do not keep a detailed portfolio, but
                an interview will prove that I'm your best candidate for
                opportunities in any of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop applications</li>
                <li>
                    Abstract tools/utilities
                    <i
                        ><small
                            >(purpose-driven CLI tools, serverless APIs,
                            etc.)</small
                        ></i
                    >
                </li>
                <li>Embedded software</li>
                <li>
                    Web development
                    <i
                        ><small
                            >(along with backend, I also do frontend, UI/UX, and
                            CI/CD)</small
                        ></i
                    >
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are better uses of your screen real estate than a list of
                specific technologies I'm familiar with. With that being said,
                recruiters may value some of the non-technical parts of my
                toolset; I'm very comfortable in all sorts of common
                productivity software (MS Office suite & its copycats),
                commercial collaboration and ticketing systems (Jira/Confluence,
                GitHub, etc.), and all common operating systems
                (Windows/macOS/Linux). Communication & diplomacy in a workplace
                setting is one of my strong suits as I am patient with the
                under-informed and fluent in all forms of English.
            </p>
