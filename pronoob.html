            <h3>Dear ProNoob,</h3>
            <p>I trust this letter finds you in the midst of one of your countless endeavors, which, judging by our previous interactions, are undoubtedly filled with the same level of enthusiasm and gravitas as your approach to leisure activities. It is with a mixture of bemusement and mild dismay that I find myself compelled to address a matter of considerable social import that has recently surfaced within our circle of acquaintances.</p>
            <p> It has come to my attention—rather reluctantly, I might add—that you have chosen to abstain from joining our weekly ritual of engaging with the incomparable animated masterpiece that is SpongeBob SquarePants. I must admit, this development has not merely been a source of surprise but has gradually evolved into a deeply felt disappointment.</p>
            <p>One would be remiss not to recognize the cultural and intellectual significance that SpongeBob SquarePants holds. It is a veritable repository of sophisticated humor, layered satire, and an intricate narrative that traverses the boundaries of simple animation. The series, while ostensibly whimsical, is an exquisite commentary on the human condition and societal norms, wrapped in the guise of undersea adventures.</p>
            <p>Your reluctance to partake in this shared experience raises intriguing questions about your capacity for appreciating the finer nuances of contemporary animated art. One might argue that your aversion—or perhaps indifference—betrays a rather curious disposition, one that appears to be somewhat divorced from the collective enthusiasm that this particular show elicits from those of us who find solace in its cleverness and charm.</p>
            <p>The collective lament of our group is palpable. There is, after all, something inherently profound in the shared experience of watching an episode and engaging in the ensuing discussion. It is a ritual that fosters camaraderie and intellectual exchange, yet your continued absence from this forum casts a shadow over what could otherwise be a harmonious and enlightening pastime.</p>
            <p>While one might venture to suggest that your absence is a matter of personal choice, it is difficult not to view it through a lens of missed opportunity. The chance to immerse oneself in the subversive wit and joyous absurdity of SpongeBob’s world is not merely a pastime but a chance to enrich one’s cultural palate. To eschew such an opportunity is, dare I say, to forfeit a piece of what makes our shared experiences richer and more engaging.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, it is with a rather detached sense of resignation that I acknowledge your position. However, I do hope that you might, in the future, reconsider your stance and deign to join us in this weekly celebration of animated brilliance. For, in doing so, you would not only enhance your own experience but contribute to the collective joy and intellectual stimulation that this cherished ritual provides.</p>
            <p>Yours in passive discontent,</p>
            <p>Ewan Green</p>
